📘 E2E Automation Project — Playwright + Pytest + Allure

Automated end‑to‑end test for eBay, built with:
- Playwright (Python)
- Pytest
- Allure reporting
- Page Object Model

The test flow includes:
1 Opening the eBay homepage
2 Performing an advanced search
3 - Opening several product pages
  - Selecting random item variations
  - Adding items to the cart
4 Verifying that the total does not exceed a defined limit

🚀 How to Run the Project
Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- pip
- Playwright
Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

📊 Reports
Allure Results
Allure is already integrated via:
--alluredir=allure-results

After running tests, a folder will appear:
